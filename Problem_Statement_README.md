# Titanic_Project--Logistic_Regression_with_Python

In this project we have used the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. 
Here we are trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased by implementing Logistic Regression in Python for classification.

We are using a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this lecture notebook.
